IMPORTANT ELEMENTOR TEMPLATES FOLDER INFO
=========================================

Elementor Templates Free/Pro

Templates from the library are now unusable and are only viewable in the library itself.

Any attempt now to connect a free Elementor account to your website so that the library is connected, will result in a failure.

For those who already had their website connected with a free Elementor account may still be able to insert templates from the library, however anybody trying it now will be denied.

Therefore, to use any of the items from the library, you will have to manually import it from the required folder of either ‘Blocks’, ‘Kits’ or ‘Pages’ from within ‘Elementor’ folder.

==================================================

Envato Elements – Access beautifully designed Template Kits + Photos from Envato Elements.

You also have access to Premium templates from Envato which you can also install manually if required.

To use these, simply install the Envato plugin found in ‘Envato Plugin’ which is included in the ‘Envato’ folder, their green icon should appear next to the add new section/template icons in Elementor.

Simply click on it and choose your template and then find it from within the ‘Envato Templates’ folder and install manually.

==================================================

Elementorism Premade Templates

You also have access to Elementorism Premade Templates by using any from the ‘Elementorism’ folder which you can also install manually if needed.
